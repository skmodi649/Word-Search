# Parallel-word-Search-using-Openmp-and-PHP
This is the mini project I developed using Openmp (PHP is used for the front end) for my parallel processing project in 6th sem in college
along with my partner Snigdh Gupta.
Abstract:
As the name suggests “word search” is about searching words in documents parallely using openmp. This is not just a simple word search but it also ranks the documents based on  the relevance of the documents with respect to the searched word.The Results are the displayed on a web page which uses PHP(Server side Scripting language) to render the result.
